# AllYourBase
Detects misusage and overwrites of vanilla bases and defs

## Why?

Overwriting (abstract) bases and defs was all the rage back in A13. Some modders haven't caught on that this is now a really bad idea and causes weird and hard to detect issues.

## Installation instructions:

1. Download.
2. https://rim-world.com/guides/how-to-install-mods/
3. Load order is irrelevant.

## Usage:

Load order is irrelevant. AllYourBase will spit out messages with the exact mod, XML node and file that misbehaves. Yellow warnings for def overwrites, red for base overwrites.

It's recommend to ~~yell at~~ educate the author of the offending mod.
